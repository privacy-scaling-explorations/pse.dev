  "description": "MACI Platform is an implementation of EasyRetroPGF with MACI. This project quickly enables any community, organization or ecosystem to run a voting round. It is highly configurable to enable different voting mechanisms (quadratic voting, quadratic funding, ranked choice, etc), gating mechanisms (token based, attestation based, hats-based, etc) and an easy-to-use UI for both round organizers and voters.",
