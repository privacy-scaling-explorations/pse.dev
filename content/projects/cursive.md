What began as an experimental initiative to transform PSE's theoretical cryptography research into tangible applications has evolved into a dedicated lab that incubates practical ways to connect people through applied cryptography.

Cursive's work creates essential feedback loops between researchers and developers, continuously improving a variety of open source codebases. They also experiment with new interfaces to experience cryptography, finding particular success with NFC technology. They have used a variety of form factors like cards, stickers, and bracelets to enable users to securely collect private data for cryptographic computations.

While initial experiments focused on creating engaging ways for users to gather data for zero-knowledge proofs, Cursive is now expanding into developing meaningful multiparty computation (MPC) interactions that put cutting-edge cryptographic research directly into users' hands.

Here are some product + research highlights:
