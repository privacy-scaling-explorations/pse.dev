ZKP2P is for defi consumers looking to onramp assets on chain quickly without going through a CEX as an intermediary. ZKP2P generates a privacy-preserving proof of payment between two users on existing payment rails like Venmo or Paypal and uses said proof to unlock escrowed digital assets on-chain.
