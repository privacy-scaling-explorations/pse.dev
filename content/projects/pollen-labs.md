Pollen Labs is driven by a mission to make a significant impact on global lives by addressing complex, pressing issues. We work alongside the community to break barriers, preserve privacy, and build a future where every voice is heard, and a free web is accessible to all. Our projects, like Channel 4, a content discovery engine, and Daisy, focusing on information transparency, embody this mission, enabling community members to earn while they engage.

We are a small team with a diverse skillset including design, engineering, community growth, and operations. We serve as a product accelerator, facilitating solutions to real-world problems with advanced blockchain technology. Our core value as follow:

- **A Decentralized Internet for All**

- **Open Source at Our Core**

- **Technology as Public Goods**

- **Privacy as a Human Right**

- **Collaboration for Impact**

Pollen Labs exits the PSE in Q4 2024 and now operates as a self-autonomous collective. Join our conversation: https://discord.gg/5B3jP2sgWS
