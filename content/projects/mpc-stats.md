## Overview

MPCStats is a framework that enables data consumers to query statistical computations across multiple data providers while ensuring privacy and result correctness. By integrating privacy-preserving technologies such as ZKP, MPC, and FHE, our goal is to provide tools and guidance for integrating privacy-preserving analysis into their workflows. We also aim to identify real-world applications that can benefit from this framework.

## Features

- **Privacy-preserving and verifiable statistical analysis**: Allows data providers to keep their inputs confidential while giving data consumers the assurance that computations are performed accurately and securely.
- **Data validity**: Integrates TLSNotary to authenticate inputs from verified web sources, ensuring data consumers can trust that data inputs are genuine and accurate.

## Use Cases

- **Cross-department data sharing and surveys**: Enables secure, private data sharing across government departments for streamlined operations and collaborative analysis.
- **Healthcare research**: Aggregates data from sources such as fitness apps and sleep trackers, allowing researchers to uncover relationships between health factors, such as fitness and sleep patterns.
- **Salary survey**: A verifiable and anonymous alternative to platforms like Glassdoor, where users can contribute salary data with privacy guarantees.
