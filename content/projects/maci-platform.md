### Overview

[MACI Platform](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci-platform/tree/main) is an implementation of EasyRetroPGF with MACI.

This project enables any community, organization or ecosystem to run a voting round.
It is highly configurable to enable different voting mechanisms (quadratic voting, quadratic funding, etc), gating mechanisms (token based, attestation based, hats-based, etc) and an easy-to-use UI for both round organizers and voters.

### Features

With MACI Platform, you can run different kind of voting rounds for your community, with the following features:

1. Full benefit of MACI's properties - Plug into MACI's anti-collusion and privacy features
2. Clean UX - The interface is optimised for voters and projects that want to participate in rounds
3. Customisable - The platform can be customised quickly to fit different use cases
